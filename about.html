							<h3>Our Values and Commitments</h3>
<ul>
							<li>We strive to be flexible: allowing students time to go deep into their interest and changing schedule or plans to accomodate.</li>
							<li>Teaching the value of regular goal setting meetings.</li>
							<li>Failure is often a pathway to learning.  Students are allowed to make mistakes in pursuit of their education; guides are understanding and demonstrate a friendliness to that error.</li>
							<li>A freedom to choose whether to work in groups or independently.</li>
							<li>The work of daily life in a community: cooking, organizing, planning, tidying, repairing, building, creating, and supporting one another.</li>
							<li>Partnering with parents.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Why The “Austen Clemens” School?</strong>
<p>We wanted to acknowledge some of our mentors and heroes, Jane Austen and Samuel Clemens, Mark Twain. Jane Austen and Samuel Clemens were astute observers and critics of their respective cultures. They responded creatively by producing whimsical and scathing reflections on their fellow humans. Austen and Clemens were writers, thinkers, and creators who responded and shaped the world through their writing.</p> 

							
							<strong>What is a microschool?</strong> <br>
							<p>A small school that is able to guide individual students to fulfill their potential in small groups with personal relationships, accountability, and many opportunities for daily student leadership. Our small size allows for flexibility, integrated learning, and support for following their passions.</p><br><br>

							<strong>Why a mixed-aged group?</strong><br> 
							<p>Students working together across age groups can flourish without competition-driven grades. Students have opportunities to learn from and teach each other without the pressure of the same age/ability ranking. The expectation is that all students are at different places developmentally and deserve the same respect, patience, and support through challenges from each other and the guides.</p><br>
